                In a city defined by its iconic food scene, New Yorkers often enjoy fresh seafood without a second thought about the journey it took to reach their plates. But behind each bite lies a complex network that connects the waters surrounding Long Island to the bustling fish markets of Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
                <br>
                Up to 80 percent of the fish and shellfish consumed in the United States is imported, much of it sourced through obscure international seafood conglomerates. These entities often procure fish from companies accused of illegal fishing practices and exploiting forced labor, as documented by the nonprofit Outlaw Ocean Project.
                <br>
                In contrast, US is a recognized global leader in sustainable seafood! US fisheries are conducted under science-based fishery management plans developed by regional fishery management councils through an open, public process, and using the best scientific information available.New York City has access to sustainable seafood resources from Long Island, offering a local and ethical alternative.

            Montauk is the state's largest commercial fishing port. 
            It serves as a hub for both commercial and sport fishing activities.

            In New York, approximately 900 state food fish license holders and 200 federally permitted vessels operate under strict regulations to ensure sustainable scup fishing. 
            These measures prevent overfishing while balancing commercial and recreational interests, protecting marine ecosystems for future generations.
