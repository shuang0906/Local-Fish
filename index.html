                In a city defined by its iconic food scene, New Yorkers often enjoy fresh seafood without a second
                thought about the journey it took to reach their plates. But behind each bite lies a complex network
                that connects the waters surrounding Long Island to the bustling fish markets of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

                Up to 80 percent of the fish and shellfish consumed in the United States is imported, much of it sourced
                through obscure international seafood conglomerates. These entities often procure fish from companies
                accused of illegal fishing practices and exploiting forced labor, as documented by the nonprofit Outlaw
                Ocean Project.

                New York State's commercial fishing industry is concentrated in several key ports and landings,
                primarily located on Long Island. Notable locations include: Greenport, Hampton Bay - Shinnicock,
                Freeport, Montauk.

            <div class="text-box text02" style="margin-bottom: 100vh;">
                Montauk is the state's largest commercial fishing port.
                It serves as a hub for both commercial and sport fishing activities.

            <div class="text-box text03" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                In New York, approximately 900 state food fish license holders and 200 federally permitted vessels
                operate under strict regulations to ensure sustainable scup fishing.
                These measures prevent overfishing while balancing commercial and recreational interests, protecting
                marine ecosystems for future generations.

                Long Island waters boast 47 species of edible fish, shellfish, and crustaceans, 
                with strict seasonal limits ensuring sustainable harvesting.

                In 2022, the top species landed by weight in New York were squid, porgy, fluke, clam, and bunker. 
                However, these local catches starkly contrast with the top five most-consumed seafood species in the U.S. in 2021—shrimp, tuna, and tilapia—most of which are imported. 
                This highlights a paradox: while local fish, such as porgy, is highly abundant locally, it remains undervalued and rarely consumed, 
                underscoring the disconnect between regional seafood production and national consumption trends.

                Fishing regulations are carefully tailored to ensure sustainability, 
                with different rules applied to various species and fishing activities. 
                For each type of fish, strict fishery management dictates 
                specific practices for commercial and recreational fishing, as well as harvest methods. 
            </div>

                For example porgy is sustainably managed and responsibly harvested under U.S. regulations.
                75 percent of commercial porgy landings are caught with otter trawls. 
                It requires that Vessels fishing must have a minimum mesh size of 5-inch diamond mesh applied throughout the 
                codend for at least 75 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net, and all other nets are properly stowed.
