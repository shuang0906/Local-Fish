                In a city defined by its iconic food scene, New Yorkers often enjoy fresh seafood without a second
                thought about the journey it took to reach their plates. But behind each bite lies a complex network
                that connects the waters surrounding Long Island to the bustling fish markets of Manhattan and Brooklyn.
                <br>
                Up to 80 percent of the fish and shellfish consumed in the United States is imported, much of it sourced
                through obscure international seafood conglomerates. These entities often procure fish from companies
                accused of illegal fishing practices and exploiting forced labor, as documented by the nonprofit Outlaw
                Ocean Project.
                <br>
                In contrast, US is a recognized global leader in sustainable seafood! US fisheries are conducted under
                science-based fishery management plans developed by regional fishery management councils through an
                open, public process, and using the best scientific information available.New York City has access to
                sustainable seafood resources from Long Island, offering a local and ethical alternative.

                New York State's commercial fishing industry is concentrated in several key ports and landings,
                primarily located on Long Island. Notable locations include: Greenport, Hampton Bay - Shinnicock,
                Freeport, Montauk.

            <div class="text-box text02" style="margin-bottom: 100vh;">
                Montauk is the state's largest commercial fishing port.
                It serves as a hub for both commercial and sport fishing activities.

            <div class="text-box text03" style="margin-bottom: 50vh;">
                In New York, approximately 900 state food fish license holders and 200 federally permitted vessels
                operate under strict regulations to ensure sustainable scup fishing.
                These measures prevent overfishing while balancing commercial and recreational interests, protecting
                marine ecosystems for future generations.
